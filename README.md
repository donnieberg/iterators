# Iterators Lab

To get set up, you need to

1. `$ cd` into your `sf-wdi-14` directory
2. Clone https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/iterators and `$ cd` into it

# Assignment
1. Write tests for each file in `/test` (files are prepared), and make sure they fail by running `mocha`; if this command cannot be found, run `$ npm install mocha chai -g` first
2. Write the methods that make these tests pass (check by running `$ mocha` again)
3. Once done, push to your own branch (named after your first name) of the iterators repository
